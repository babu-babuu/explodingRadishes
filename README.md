# explodingRadishes

This projects should serve as a test project for guys and girls in cloudTalk.


To run the test:
-> please clone the repo
-> go to explofingRadishes folder
-> run npm cypress open to run them in cypress GUI

Test case 1: add To Do Item
Test case 2: toggle and validate Note

I diverged slightly from the goven assingment -> did not utilise the first test case to set data for the second one. 
I do not consider that a scalable solution.
Data are set directly to local storage.
Thus test cases are isolated and we are not taking more time by repeating/doubling code.
